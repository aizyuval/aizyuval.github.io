                <h1>Cultivating a farm in space</h1>
    <p>March 2024</p>

    <p>
    I'm currently working in a field that is of interest to me - technology. Lacking self clarity, I'm not sure in the inegrity of working on that domain.

    </br>Two root ideas lead to this:</br>
    1. Weather or not technology is even worthwhile.</br>
    2. Weather or not I can practice technology while realizing my other domains of interests, such as freedom.</br> </br>

    It leads me to think about other lifestyles and aspirations I have, while fusing everything together creates a confusion.
    Leaving the question of technology aside, how can one unravel this mix of aspirations and trade-offs?
    <p></p>


    <h2>Do I have to choose?</h2>
    <p> Inherently, I don't care to be moderate about a thing. The only evaluation I give myself is one compared against my own wishes and their importance.
    That said, upon choosing a path in a highly competitive field, with the goal of standing out with my ideas, being moderate is defenitly not so appealing. Hence, the fear.</p>

    <p> Although I haven't decided yet, technology appeals to me as a practice that makes a positive impact. It also becomes
    more appearent that I have been giving up freedom, mostly not paying enough attention while focusing on technology. Both seem to deserve my dedication. 
</p>
    <p>The catch is: weather doing both force me to not be dedicated enough in one field? It is reasonable to think that I can lose both while trying to achieve it all. Does that mean I better choose between the two?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Inherent dedication or part time?</h2>

    <p> Is something worthwhile doing if it's only for a few hours in a day? <br>

    Reading has proven itself for me to be highly valueable and enjoyable at the same time, while consuming only a few hours each day. It is fair to say 
    that I'm dedicated enough (as per my standards) to reading, with only a few hours a day rather than the whole day, everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dedication is a relative thing. Being dedicated to my part-time-money-making job could be satisfied with arriving 1 hour earlier everyday. That's enough, because it fits well with
    the importance levels of the object. That is not the same as in other domains.

    It is all about standards - with higher importance levels, higher dedication levels ensue to satisfy the goals.
    </p>

    <p>
    What is then the appropriate timespan, to both fit as enough time for realizing my aspirations in the field of technology, without comprimising other important themes such as reading 
    and being a free man? 
    Such a balance might not even exist, as these fields together might run out of space.
    <br>
    I must find out.
